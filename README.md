Package hash2curve implements Hashing to Elliptic Curves as specified in [RFC 9380](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9380).
It exposed a minimal API so you don't have to worry about the parameters.

The following table shows supported groups with hash-to-curve capability and links each one to the underlying
implementations:

| Curve        | Backend                       |
|--------------|-------------------------------|
| Ristretto255 | github.com/gtank/ristretto255 |
| P-256        | filippo.io/nistec             |
| P-384        | filippo.io/nistec             |
| P-521        | filippo.io/nistec             |
| Edwards25519 | filippo.io/edwards25519       |
| Secp256k1    | github.com/bytemare/secp256k1 |

#### What is hash2curve?

> Hashing to Elliptic Curves allows for encoding or hashing an arbitrary string to a point on an elliptic curve
> (or element in a group), therefore benefiting from interesting mathematical properties very useful in cryptographic
> protocols, like CPace, VOPRF, and OPAQUE.
